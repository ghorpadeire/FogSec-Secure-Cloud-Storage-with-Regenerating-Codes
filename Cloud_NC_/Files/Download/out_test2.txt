ABSTRACT:
In recent years cloud storage services have gained much attention, there is a growing demand for innovative solutions that address the inherent limitations of traditional platforms, particularly concerning privacy, latency, and availability. This project introduces a novel approach to storage systems by leveraging the principles of fog computing, tapping into edge resources to enhance classical cloud storage services. Our proposed distributed storage system aims to overcome the shortcomings of conventional cloud storage by integrating fog computing into its architecture. A key element of our design is a strategic placement algorithm that disperses data across various storage components. Drawing inspiration from well-established methods in information theory and cryptography, we implement a robust storage solution. Through empirical analysis, we demonstrate that our system excels in preserving user privacy 
while ensuring high availability. We plan to implement a fault tolerance mechanism with up to 50% storage server redundancy, bolstering the system's resilience. The incorporation of regenerating codes enhances fault tolerance, minimizing repair bandwidth and safeguarding against data corruption in cloud storage.  This work contributes to the evolving landscape of storage solutions, offering a privacy-preserving and highly available alternative that addresses t he contemporary challenges faced by cloud storage services.
OBJECTIVE 
The objective of this project is to pioneer a distributed storage system that integrates fog computing, strategically dispersing data to address traditional cloud storage limitations. Leveraging regenerating codes and innovative algorithms, the system aims to enhance privacy, availability, and fault tolerance while introducing a secure public auditing scheme for data integrity verification.
