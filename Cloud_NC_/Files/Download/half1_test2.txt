ABSTRACT:
In recent years cloud storage services have gained much attention, there is a growing demand for innovative solutions that address the inherent limitations of traditional platforms, particularly concerning privacy, latency, and availability. This project introduces a novel approach to storage systems by leveraging the principles of fog computing, tapping into edge resources to enhance classical cloud storage services. Our proposed distributed storage system aims to overcome the shortcomings of conventional cloud storage by integrating fog computing into its architecture. A key element of our design is a strategic placement algorithm that disperses data across various storage components. Drawing inspiration from well-established methods in information theory and cryptography, we implement a robust storage solution. Through empirical analysis, we demonstrate that our system excels in preserving user privacy
