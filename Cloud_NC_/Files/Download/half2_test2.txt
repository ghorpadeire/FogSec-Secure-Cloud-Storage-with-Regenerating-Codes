while ensuring high availability. We plan to implement a fault tolerance mechanism with up to 50% storage server redundancy, bolstering the system's resilience. The incorporation of regenerating codes enhances fault tolerance, minimizing repair bandwidth and safeguarding against data corruption in cloud storage.  This work contributes to the evolving landscape of storage solutions, offering a privacy-preserving and highly available alternative that addresses t he contemporary challenges faced by cloud storage services.
OBJECTIVE 
The objective of this project is to pioneer a distributed storage system that integrates fog computing, strategically dispersing data to address traditional cloud storage limitations. Leveraging regenerating codes and innovative algorithms, the system aims to enhance privacy, availability, and fault tolerance while introducing a secure public auditing scheme for data integrity verification.
