to overcome the shortcomings of conventional cloud storage by integrating fog computing into its architecture. A key element of our design is a strategic placement algorithm that disperses data across various storage components. Also we focus on the integrity verification problem in regenerating-code-based cloud storage, especially with the functional repair strategy. To fully ensure the data integrity and save the users’ computation resources as well as online burden, we propose a public auditing scheme for the regenerating-code-based cloud storage, in which the integrity checking and regeneration (of failed data blocks and authenticators) are implemented by a third party auditor and a semi-trusted proxy separately on behalf of the data owner. Instead of directly adapting the existing public auditing scheme to the multi-server setting, we design a novel authenticator, which is more appropriate for regenerating codes.

METHODOLOGY
Our methodology for implementing the proposed distributed storage system involves a multifaceted approach aimed at ensuring security, privacy, and efficiency. The initial phase focuses on designing and implementing encryption and decryption mechanisms to protect user data. A robust encryption algorithm is developed to the unauthorized access, enhancing the security and privacy of stored information. Simultaneously, we integrate Quick Retrieval Techniques (QRT) to optimize data accessibility, ensuring swift retrieval from distributed storage components. To address strategic data placement, we incorporate a hashing technique into our algorithm, intelligently dispersing data across diverse storage components. This algorithm is intricately crafted to optimize storage utilization, minimize latency, and bolster availability, leveraging fog computing principles and edge resources. Our methodology introduces a tailored public auditing scheme for regenerating-code-based cloud storage, specifically targeting the integrity verification problem, with a focus on the functional repair strategy. This scheme minimizes user computation resources and online burdens by employing a third-party auditor and a semi-trusted proxy for integrity checking and regeneration on behalf of the data owner. An innovative authenticator, designed for regenerating codes, enhances the efficiency of this scheme. To assess performance and security, a comprehensive analysis is conducted. Performance evaluations demonstrate the feasibility and integration capabilities of our scheme within a regenerating-code-based cloud storage environment. Security evaluation involves scrutinizing correctness in our auditing scheme, analyzing soundness and secure guarantees. This methodology ensures the successful implementation and validation of our proposed system, contributing significantly to the evolution of secure and efficient cloud storage solutions.
