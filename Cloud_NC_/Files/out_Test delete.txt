ABSTRACT:
In recent years cloud storage services have gained much attention, there is a growing demand for innovative solutions that address the inherent limitations of traditional platforms, particularly concerning privacy, latency, and availability. This project introduces a novel approach to storage systems by leveraging the principles of fog computing, tapping into edge resources to enhance classical cloud storage services. Our proposed distributed storage system aims to overcome the shortcomings of conventional cloud storage by integrating fog computing into its architecture. A key element of our design is a strategic placement algorithm that disperses data across various storage components. Drawing inspiration from well-established methods in information theory and cryptography, we implement a robust storage solution. Through empirical analysis, we demonstrate that our system excels in preserving user privacy while ensuring high availability. We plan to implement a fault tolerance mechanism with up to 50% storage server redundancy, bolstering the system's resilience. The incorporation of regenerating codes enhances fault tolerance, minimizing repair bandwidth and safeguarding against data corruption in cloud storage.  This work contributes to the evolving landscape of storage solutions, offering a privacy-preserving and highly available alternative that addresses the contemporary challenges faced by cloud storage services.

In recent years cloud storage services have gained much attention, there is a growing demand for innovative solutions that address the inherent limitations of traditional platforms, particularly concerning privacy, latency, and availability.

EXISTING SYSTEM:
In the Existing system Data owners lose ultimate control over the fate of their outsourced data; thus, the correctness, availability and integrity of the data are being put at risk. On the one hand, the cloud service is usually faced with a broad range of internal/external adversaries, who would maliciously delete or corrupt users’ data; on the other hand, the cloud service Many mechanisms dealing with the integrity of outsourced data without a local copy have been proposed under different system and security models up to now. The most significant work among these studies are the PDP (provable data possession) model and POR (proof of irretrievability) model, which were originally proposed for the single-server. Considering that files are usually striped and redundantly stored across multi-servers or multi-clouds explore integrity verification schemes suitable for such multi-servers or multicourse setting with different redundancy schemes, such as
Replication, erasure codes, and, more recently, regenerating codes.

 DISADVANTAGE OF EXISTING SYSTEM:
	The outsourced data in cloud storage against corruptions, adding fault tolerance to cloud storage together with data integrity checking and failure reparation becomes critical.

PROPOSED SYSTEM
In our work, we focus on distributed storage system aims to overcome the shortcomings of conventional cloud storage by integrating fog computing into its architecture. A key element of our design is a strategic placement algorithm that disperses data across various storage components. Also we focus on the integrity verification problem in regenerating-code-based cloud storage, especially with the functional repair strategy. To fully ensure the data integrity and save the users’ computation resources as well as online burden, we propose a public auditing scheme for the regenerating-code-based cloud storage, in which the integrity checking and regeneration (of failed data blocks and authenticators) are implemented by a third party auditor and a semi-trusted proxy separately on behalf of the data owner. Instead of directly adapting the existing public auditing scheme to the multi-server setting, we design a novel authenticator, which is more appropriate for regenerating codes.

FUNCTIONAL SYSTEM ARCHITECHTURE
 



¬¬TECHNIQUE AND ALGORITHMS:
	Encryption and Decryption¬¬¬¬
	Quick Retrieval Technique (QRT).
	Hashing Technique

ADVANTAGE OF PROPOSED SYSTEM:
	Our scheme is provable secure and the performance evaluation shows that our scheme is highly efficient and can be feasibly integrated into a regenerating-code-based cloud storage system.
	Security: elaborate on the correctness of verification in our auditing scheme and then formally evaluate the security by analyzing its fulfillment of soundness, regeneration-unforgivable and secure guarantee.
