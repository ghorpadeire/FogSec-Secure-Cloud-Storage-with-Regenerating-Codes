system aims to overcome the shortcomings of conventional cloud storage by integrating fog computing into its architecture. A key element of our design is a strategic placement algorithm that disperses data across various storage components. Drawing inspiration from well-established methods in information theory and cryptography, we implement a robust storage solution. Through empirical analysis, we demonstrate that our system excels in preserving user privacy
