e system aims to overcome the shortcomings of conventional cloud storage by integrating fog computing into its architecture. A key element of our design is a strategic placement algorithm that disperses data across various storage components. Also we focus on the integrity verification problem in regenerating-code-based cloud storage, especially with the functional repair strategy. To fully ensure the data integrity and save the users’ computation resources as well as online burden, we propose a public auditing scheme for the regenerating-code-based cloud storage, in which the integrity checking and regeneration (of failed data blocks and authenticators) are implemented by a third party auditor and a semi-trusted proxy separately on behalf of the data owner. Instead of directly adapting the existing public auditing scheme to the multi-server setting, we design a novel authenticator, which is more appropriate for regenerating codes.

FUNCTIONAL SYSTEM ARCHITECHTURE
 



¬¬TECHNIQUE AND ALGORITHMS:
	Encryption and Decryption¬¬¬¬
	Quick Retrieval Technique (QRT).
	Hashing Technique

ADVANTAGE OF PROPOSED SYSTEM:
	Our scheme is provable secure and the performance evaluation shows that our scheme is highly efficient and can be feasibly integrated into a regenerating-code-based cloud storage system.
	Security: elaborate on the correctness of verification in our auditing scheme and then formally evaluate the security by analyzing its fulfillment of soundness, regeneration-unforgivable and secure guarantee.
