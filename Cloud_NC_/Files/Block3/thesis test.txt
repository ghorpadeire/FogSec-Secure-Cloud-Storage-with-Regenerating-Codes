ge resources. Our methodology introduces a tailored public auditing scheme for regenerating-code-based cloud storage, specifically targeting the integrity verification problem, with a focus on the functional repair strategy. This scheme minimizes user computation resources and online burdens by employing a third-party auditor and a semi-trusted proxy for integrity checking and regeneration on behalf of the data owner. An innovative authenticator, designed for regenerating codes, enhances the efficiency of this scheme. To assess performance and security, a comprehensive analysis is conducted. Performance evaluations demonstrate the feasibility and integration capabilities of our scheme within a regenerating-code-based cloud storage environment. Security evaluation involves scrutinizing correctness in our auditing scheme, analyzing soundness and secure guarantees. This methodology ensures the successful implementation and validation of our proposed system, contributing significantly to the evolution of secure and efficient cloud storage solutions.
