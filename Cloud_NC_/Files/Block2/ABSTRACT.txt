while ensuring high availability. We plan to implement a fault tolerance mechanism with up to 50% storage server redundancy, bolstering the system's resilience. The incorporation of regenerating codes enhances fault tolerance, minimizing repair bandwidth and safeguarding against data corruption in cloud storage.  This work contributes to the evolving landscape of storage solutions, offering a privacy-preserving and highly available alternative that addresses t
