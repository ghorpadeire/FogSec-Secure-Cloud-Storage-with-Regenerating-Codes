ud storage.  This work contributes to the evolving landscape of storage solutions, offering a privacy-preserving and highly available alternative that addresses the contemporary challenges faced by cloud storage services.

EXISTING SYSTEM:
In the Existing system Data owners lose ultimate control over the fate of their outsourced data; thus, the correctness, availability and integrity of the data are being put at risk. On the one hand, the cloud service is usually faced with a broad range of internal/external adversaries, who would maliciously delete or corrupt users’ data; on the other hand, the cloud service Many mechanisms dealing with the integrity of outsourced data without a local copy have been proposed under different system and security models up to now. The most significant work among these studies are the PDP (provable data possession) model and POR (proof of irretrievability) model, which were originally proposed for the single-server. Considering that files are usually striped and redundantly stored across multi-servers or multi-clouds explore integrity verification schemes suitable for such multi-servers or multicourse setting with different redundancy schemes, such as
Replication, erasure codes, and, more recently, regenerating codes.

 DISADVANTAGE OF EXISTING SYSTEM:
	The outsourced data in cloud storage against corruptions, adding fault tolerance to cloud storage together with data integrity checking and failure reparation becomes critical.

PROPOSED SYSTEM
In our work, we focus on distributed storag
